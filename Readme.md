# Java Calculator

A simple Java console-based calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation. This project demonstrates how to handle user input, apply control flow using the `switch` statement, and use mathematical functions in Java.

## Features

- Supports +, -, \*, /, and ^ operations
- Handles division-by-zero errors gracefully
- Uses Java's modern switch expression syntax (`case 'x' ->`)
- Beginner-friendly and easy to understand

## Concepts Used

- Java `Scanner` class for user input
- Switch statements and conditional logic
- Mathematical operations using `Math.pow()`
- Error handling and validation

## Tools & Technologies

- Language: Java SE
- IDE: IntelliJ IDEA / VS Code

## Goal

To strengthen fundamental programming logic and Java syntax through hands-on coding.
